{"id":"dotfiles-701","title":"Distribute workspaces across monitors like AeroSpace","description":"## Problem\nRift gives each display its own independent 10 workspaces (1-0). User wants the AeroSpace model: 10 global workspaces distributed across monitors.\n\n- Main monitor (VG279QE5A (1), screen_id=3): workspaces 1, 2, 3, 4\n- Left monitor (VG279QE5A (2), screen_id=2): workspaces 5, 6, 7\n- MacBook (Built-in Retina, screen_id=1): workspaces 8, 9, 0\n\n## Current Behavior\nEach monitor bar shows all 10 workspaces (1-0) because Rift has 10 per display. Pressing opt+5 switches workspace 5 on the CURRENT display — it doesn't jump to the left monitor.\n\n## Desired Behavior\nWorkspace numbers are globally unique. opt+5 focuses the left monitor and activates its first workspace. opt+shift+5 moves focused window there.\n\n## What Needs To Change\n\n### SketchyBar (spaces_rift.lua)\nAdd a workspace assignment map (which global workspace numbers go to which display). Each bar only shows its assigned subset with the correct global labels. For example, the left monitor bar shows items labeled 5, 6, 7 that map to Rift workspace indices 0, 1, 2 on that display's space.\n\n### Rift Keybindings\nEach global workspace hotkey (opt+N) needs to become a compound command:\n1. Focus the correct display: rift-cli execute display focus --index \u003cdisplay_index\u003e\n2. Switch to the local workspace: rift-cli execute workspace switch \u003clocal_index\u003e\n\nSimilarly opt+shift+N (move window) would use rift-cli execute display move-window + workspace switch.\n\n### Rift CLI Reference\n- rift-cli execute display focus --index \u003c0-based\u003e\n- rift-cli execute display move-window --index \u003c0-based\u003e\n- rift-cli execute workspace switch \u003c0-based\u003e\n- rift-cli execute workspace move-window \u003c0-based\u003e\n\n## Open Questions\n- Where should the workspace-to-display assignment map live? (settings.lua? rift config? both?)\n- Does the Rift config already have keybindings that need updating, or is that separate?\n- Should the map be hardcoded per monitor profile (like the old AeroSpace settings.monitors.profiles) or dynamic?","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"stevedimakos97@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-16T21:51:39.668012-05:00","created_by":"steez","updated_at":"2026-02-16T21:51:39.668012-05:00"}
