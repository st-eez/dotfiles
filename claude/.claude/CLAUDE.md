# Rules

1. Context7: Fetch library docs via MCP before code generation
2. No AI branding in commits (no signatures, co-authored-by, metadata)
3. Web searches: Use current year from env "Today's date" field
4. Conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `chore:`
5. Plans: Use descriptive filenames like `feature-name-plan.md`, never random names
