**Hypothesis**: Explicit section-specific quality criteria improve output.

**Result**: -0.08 avg score (p=0.37), not significant. Hurt system-design tasks.

**Lesson**: Rigid constraints ("3-5 steps", "single measurable goal") cause over-simplification on complex tasks. Keep instructions flexible.
